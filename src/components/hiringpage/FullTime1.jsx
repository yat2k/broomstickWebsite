            1. The Candidate would be working with the Core R&D team at BroomStick.<br/>
            2. Work on defining and solving Fluid Mechanics problems of the product.<br/>
            3. Work o creating and implementing technologies that would address the problem statement. Both in digital and physical prototypes<br/>
            4. Work on simulations and analysis and neatly portray the results.<br/>
            5. The role is strictly WFO.<br/>
            6. The candidate would be assisted in the more complicated tasks and would have the learning opportunities to better his/her career.<br/>
            7. The Candidate is expected to sign NDA for his/her tenure.<br/>

            1. Should have CFD intrests.<br/>
            2. Knowledge of Turbulence Modelling is a must.(ke,kw-SST,RANS working Knowledge).<br/>
            3. Should be able to model, simulate and interpret results; from the given real-world scenario.<br/>
            4. Should have 3D Blade design knowledge(from fluid/flow parameters to CAD Model)
            (end-to-end results expected).<br/>
            5. Should have a working knowledge of simulation software like ANSYS Fluent or similar platforms. (ANSYS preffered)<br/>
            6. A better understanding of programming language (C,C++,Python) is a bonus. (UDF Codes for custom physics definition)<br/>
            7. Knowledge of DPM is an added advantage.<br/>
            8. Experience in Flow Viz technique is a bonus.<br/>
